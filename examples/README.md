# Examples

These samples can be executed using `ts-node` or `tsx`:

```
ts-node ./examples/ws-public.ts
```

Most examples also have minimal typescript, so if you rename them to "js" they should execute fine with just node. TypeScript is recommended but completely optional:

```
node ./examples/spot/getTickers.js
```
